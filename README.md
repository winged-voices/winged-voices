## salutations!

I'm faye; you will see me stylize it in lowercase most of the time because I genuinely prefer that...?  
(Do I know if that's because I came of age in the "it's cool to write in lowercase" era of the internet or if I just like the curve of the f better in most typefaces? No, I have no idea.)   

### things about me 
I did this as a bullet list and it looked *terrible* so I'm making it back into paragraphs for everyone's sake.   
Basically: I'm mostly learning as I go; it's not very hard to tell that I am both self-taught and not very confident.   
<details><summary> background, interests, etc:</summary> 
**Quick origin story**: I taught myself some (now incredibly weird to think about) coding and layout design from ... being a tween on the internet in the LJ/MySpace days, and then an internship and a few specific projects convinced me after nearly an entire English major that I enjoyed the combo of tech and graphic design that was web design in the *mumblemumbleaughts* enough to want to try to take a separate certificate.

I was neither in a good place back then or the most motivated, so, shocker, this **did not** get me a fantastic new frontend career. It **did** get me some useful skills and an iMac that lasted about a decade, and I also got some experience freelancing for friends and so on that sort of punted my day jobs into tech-adjacent stuff, which has been interesting and wildly all over the place in terms of what I do. 

**Anyway:** I've never stopped being interested or trying to learn things! Mostly from free courses on the internet or squinting a lot at other people's code. Documentation is my friend :D :D  

I enjoy that Github really leans on MAKE A DAMN README and I love the open source ideology, and I keep trying to save things to spruce up my Obsidian; so I figured I'd make an account and play around.

### more fun than that: 
I also write üñ•, play ttrpgs üé≤ (and ~~tt~~rpgsüìÑ), read a lot of articlesüì∞... lose a lot of bookmarksüìå...  
I like to draw and make 3-D art but I've kind of accepted that I'm not great at it. Still, I do want to practice more.  
I have ADHD that impressed the neuropsych examiner; also epilepsy and migraines, basically fœÖ—ÅŒ∫[^1] my brain.  

[^1] I was trying to censor myself without censoring myself here, but never do this for any real length of time.  
The unicode, I mean. Please don't do it for fancy display names and stuff. Screen readers can't figure it out, and it's not polite to use characters from other languages to look like English.

Ahem. One of my other passions is championing disability rights! In life, in code, and in writing/roleplay. 

### Back to work!
To pay the rent I'm currently working freelance/contract as a (they don't usually SAY this, but it totally is) reinforcement learning specialist for LLMs and the like. 
....But it's way funnier to say *I gaslight AIs* which is not ...*not* true, depending on what project I'm working on.</details>

### what I know (and want to know)
<details><summary> pt 1:</summary> 

## languages  
### markups  
- Markdown ‚úî (esp the Obsidian flavor, but I use it for my job, too, so)    
- HTML and XHTML: ‚úî     
	- legitimate question: does anyone even *use* XHTML? I remember when I was first learning web design the course instructor was very *this is the future* yeah nah     
- Wikitext of various flavors ‚úî     
- CSS ‚ùì    
	- let's call this "four years of high school spanish" fluency: can read, can write\[make adjustments to existing CSS or use reference to compose], speaking\[ie writing from scratch or memory]... not so much    
	- I'm currently trying to learn this more fl     
- JSON ‚úî     
	- pranked myself on this one since last time: it comes in handy at work so i'm definitely good with it.
		- it feels like cheating in much the way XML (see below) does to me, but i'm starting to think that's actually just "codes with not a lot of predefined variables/keys/etc" to someone who started on html, which is nothing but a big dictionary. 
 	~~i think this is the "where's the bathroom / i speak english" level of dropped-in immersion~~

<sup>(also, XML: which I also use at work, but I feel like XML is kind of cheater markup if you're the one defining the tags. Yes, I can follow my own rules in such a way that a computer knows the difference between two things, I guess? Which is, I guess, sort of all code is, but. It's like saying I speak my own conlang well. Yes, it has phonemes and grammatical structures I didn't invent but I didn't have to learn it.)</sup>     
  
### programming  
- SQL ‚úî just basics, but i have a shiny certificate and all that  
	- my household got into an es-cue-ell vs sequel argument (I say S Q L) before I even knew that was a thing and then we hit Wikipedia  
	- I enjoy the reason it's historically referred to as "Sequel". I still say SQL.     
		- So how do *you* say it?  
- Python üìö currently learning  
- JavaScript's my ~~next one~~ *oops apparently I'm at least teaching myself JS at a basic level because I got too interested in integrating Spotify in a new way and now I have a slow-burning project idea* 
	- Tho *tech*nically since I'm using the Obsidian Dataview plugin, and some others, I'm getting a crashcourse in Javascript here and there      
		- (and also DQL and whatever other -QLs people choose to use; plus some Handlebar/Moustache/etc.  
		- SQL made adapting to all other query languages pretty easy: do recommend)  

### uh, spoken?  (in which I'm being silly)   
- ASL üìö currently learning
	- and would love love love anyone to sign with! HMU!   
- English ‚úî born into this bizarre language  
- Spanish ‚ùì in the exact way mentioned in the CSS section  
	- somehow, I managed to translate *Don Quixote* into English in HS but can't have a fluent conversation?!  
	- I can eavesdrop pretty accurately though so maybe it's just confidence  
- French ‚ùì more recently studied and therefore slightly better pronounced, but with a smaller vocabulary  
	- I would really like to master French tbh
 	- weird but true: if you have trouble with your Rs in English as a little kid, maybe you will do better with French Rs: I do!
- Welsh  ‚Åâ
	- keep trying to learn it, I love it, I love the history, have never committed well enough.
 	- this is not a romance language. OR a germanic language. and that's beautiful. but DAMN.   
- German ‚ùå  
	- ...tbf I retained a great grasp on the *theory* of German, but I doubt I could remember much vocab.  
		- if you are seriously depressed, have weirdly escalating epilepsy, and undiagnosed (not that I ...knew) ADHD: take a year off  
- not a spoken language but I'm also learning Morse Code! for funsies! will probably *never* master that one  
- I can read music fluently??
