## salutations!

I'm Faye; you will see me stylize it in lowercase most of the time because I genuinely prefer that? (Do I know if that's because I came of age in the "it's cool to write in lowercase" era of the internet or if I just like the curve of the f better in most typefaces? No, I have no idea.) 

### things about me 
I did this as a bullet list and it looked *terrible* so I'm making it back into paragraphs for everyone's sake. 
Basically: I'm mostly learning as I go; it's not very hard to tell that I am both self-taught and not very confident. 

<details><summary>##### The extended summary:</summary> 
I figured out from a few specific projects and an internship, after nearly an entire English major, that I really loved graphic and web design. What you'd call UI or frontend now, but at the time *mumblemumbleaughts* required knowing allll the things. 

I tried, not very successfully, to take a course in web design to 180 that problem. I was neither in a good place at 20 and feeling lost, or the most motivated to do it while also finishing school; it **did not** get me a fantastic new frontend freelancing career. It **did** get me some useful skills and a "free" iMac which lasted like a decade and honestly, worth it. (Esp bc it was right before they came out with the totally un-upgradable BS they have now. I have since fully transitioned back to Windows, and also, worth it. Or rather, I kinda hate Microsoft too, but building your own PC is way superior to whatever the hell you can do with Apple's planned obsolescence, and they know it's the operating system and apps people want, so they make dual booting a pain in the ass. /rant)

**Anyway:** I've never stopped trying to learn things! Mostly from free courses on the internet or squinting a lot at other people's code. Documentation is my friend :D :D i enjoy that Github really leans on MAKE A DAMN README

#### More fun: 
I also write üñ•, play ttrpgs üé≤ (and ~~tt~~rpgsüìÑ), read a lot of articlesüì∞... lose a lot of bookmarksüìå...
I like to draw and make 3-D art but I've kind of accepted that I'm not great at it. Still, I do want to practice more.
I have ADHD that impressed the neuropsych examiner; also epilepsy and migraines, basically fœÖ—ÅŒ∫<sup>‚òÖ</sup> my brain

<sup>‚òÖ</sup><small>I was trying to censor myself without censoring myself here, but never do this for any real length of time.
The unicode, I mean. Please don't do it for fancy display names and stuff. Screen readers can't figure it out, and it's not polite to use characters from other languages to look like English.</small>

Ahem. One of my other passions is championing disability rights! In life, in code, and in writing/roleplay. 

#### Back to work! 
To pay the rent I'm currently working freelance/contract as a (they don't usually SAY this, but it totally is) prompt engineer and reinforcement learning specialist for LLMs. 
....But it's way funnier to say *I gaslight AIs* which is not ...*not* true (sometimes it's "*I criticize AIs*")

<summary>## What I know (and want to know):</summary> 
### languages  
#### markups  
- Markdown ‚úî (esp the Obsidian flavor, but I work with it too, so)    
- HTML and XHTML: ‚úî     
	- legitimate question: does anyone even *use* XHTML? I remember when I was first learning web design in *mumblemumbleaughts* the course instructor was very *this is the future* yeah nah     
- Wikitext of various flavors ‚úî     
- CSS ‚ùì    
	- let's call this "four years of high school spanish" fluency: can read, can write \[make adjustments], speaking \[eg writing from scratch] ... not so much    
	- I'm currently trying to learn this more fluently     
- JSON ‚Åâ    
  - I can and have edited a JSON file, situationally, without screwing it up??? i think this is the "where's the bathroom/i speak english" immersion level    
  
#### programming  
- SQL ‚úî just basics, but i have a shiny certificate and all that  
	- my household got into an es-cue-ell vs sequel argument (I say S Q L) before I even knew that was a thing and then we hit Wikipedia  
	- I enjoy the reason it's historically referred to as "Sequel". I still say SQL.     
		- So how do *you* say it?  
- Python üìö currently learning  
- nothing else well. JavaScript's my next one.  
	- Tho technically since I'm using the Obsidian Dataview plugin, and some others, I'm getting a crashcourse in Javascript here and there      
	- (and also DQL and whatever other -QLs people choose to use; plus some Handlebar/Moustache/etc.  
		- SQL made adapting to queries pretty easy: do recommend)  

#### uh, spoken?  
- in which I'm being silly   
- ASL üìö currently learning and would love love love anyone to sign with!   
- English ‚úî born into this bizarre language  
- Spanish ‚ùì in the exact way mentioned above  
	- somehow, I managed to translate *Don Quixote* into English in HS but can't have a fluent conversation?!  
	- I can eavesdrop pretty accurately though so maybe it's just confidence  
- French ‚ùì more recently studied and therefore slightly better pronounced, but with a smaller vocabulary  
	- I would really like to master French tbh   
- German ‚ùå  
	- ...tbf I have a great grasp on the *theory* of German, but I doubt I could remember much.  
		- if you are seriously depressed, have weirdly escalating epilepsy, and undiagnosed (not that I ...knew) ADHD: take a year off  
- not a spoken language but I'm also learning Morse Code! for funsies! will probably *never* master that one  
- I can read music fluently??
